# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Echelon Supply Chain Optimization

This is a tutorial on multi-echelon inventory optimization (MEIO) using reinforcement learning. We define an environment with a factory and several warehouses and show how the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm can be used to implement the production and replenishment policy.

(This tutorial was transfered from .ipynb to .py and slightly updated by Antoine Germain (agermain@mit.edu) in July 2024. All credits go to the original author. Here is the original .ipynb document, which has been modified in this folder:)

# Run the .py file

To run the file, please follow these steps using a bash terminal and making MEIO your working folder:

### Conda environment and rllib-ddpg

Type the following lines one by one in your bash terminal:

```
conda create -n rllib-ddpg python=3.10
conda activate rllib-ddpg
cd ddpg
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e '.[development]'
cd ..
```

If you get a message telling you "CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate'", you might need to write 
```
source activate base
``` 
before activating the rllib-ddpg folder.

### Other libraries
```
pip install qbstyles ray[rllib] ax-platform
pip install seaborn
pip install pandas
conda uninstall pytorch
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

### Running the code

```
python MEIO.py
```
